    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            12 out of      12  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      12    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      12    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  18,224    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
